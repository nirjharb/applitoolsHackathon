# applitoolsHackathon
As mentioned in the instructions under https://applitools.com/cross-browser-testing-hackathon-v20-1-instructions/, the code has been written under one folder for traditional test. There are two src files viz. TraditionalTestsV1.java and TraditionalTestsV2.java. 

TraditionalTests : Video URL showing the automation : https://www.screencast.com/t/pJ4Sk4TyK5zD

I have automated the entire flow using selenium and java for the Applifashion application. It took me around 20+ hours to complete this enormous task!! As you can see from the video URL, screen shots are auto-generated using TestNG Library. 

By following the Video URL, you should be able to run the project from Eclipse IDE by importing the project in it.

For ModernTests V1 and V2, please refer to the video url : https://www.screencast.com/t/J9GrEIiI

It took me around 2.5 hours to complete the stuff. Things were super cool and implementation was really easy [Documentation helped a lot! Thank you for that].  Request you to refer to the code base and check how it went. For executing it just follow the video and it would work.

Please let me know what you think. 

Note : Bug Region doesn't work on Demo version. However I have showed the bugs in details in video URL that I have shared.

Thank you.

Cordially,

Nirjhar Banik
